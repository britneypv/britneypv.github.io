            <p>Hello! My name is Britney Pham-Vu, a junior at the University of Texas at Austin. 
                I am studying Computer and Electrical Engineering and I am currently making this webpage as part of a homework assignment for my Software Lab class. This is my first time working frontend, so it's a little tricky and I'm working pretty slowly.
                I was born in Charlotte, North Carolina, but I've lived in Austin for nearly my whole life. 
                I am very family oriented and I love spending time with family and friends.
                I have a 10 year old Chiweenie named Kiwi and she is my world. She is very sassy and yappy but I accept her for who she is.
                That is pretty much it about me.
            </p>

            <h3 class="header">My Hobbies</h3>
            <p>Some activities I enjoy doing in my free time include reading, playing piano, and Spikeball. 
                I especially love playing Spikeball with my friends after a long day. It alleviates a lot of stress and is tons of fun!
                I play piano for my church, so I often spend time practicing for that.
                My current favorite book is Scythe by Neal Shusterman.
